=================================================
Revisions to new code (since master-2010-06-03)
=================================================

dev-2010-06-29-rewrite_step1:
*wrote GetRawEvent to skip writing telescope.root; just grab data from the .rz files directly
*RawEventDisplay displays raw data
*initial EventAnalyze (and support class SlidingPedestal) write based on master-2010-06-03/SlidingPedestalV4.cpp, but BROKEN
--------------------

dev-2010-07-02-rewrite_pedestal_analyze:
*rewrote GetRawEvent and RawEvent displays to depend on Schaffner's event class structures
*for 10k events from RZ to ped_sub.root, reduction in memory usage from 129mb to 64mb and reduction in cpu time from 59sec to 53sec 
--------------------

dev-2010-07-06-rewrite_pedestal_analyze:
*new output data format with zero suppression
--------------------

dev-2010-07-08-rewrite_pedestal_analyze:
*decreased size of output events
--------------------

dev-2010-07-11-rewrite_clustering:
*start structure of clustering
*optimized version of SlidingPedestal reduces calculation time for 10k events from 49s to 6s but slight precision errors
*compiles now but runs at 1/10 speed with command: g++ -o PedestalAnalyze.exe PedestalAnalyze.cpp `root-config --cflags --glibs`
*reads settings from Settings.ini now; no more recompiling to change settings
--------------------

dev-2010-07-22-rewrite_clustering:
*Now does clustering through Clustering.class.cpp 
*Imports settings from Setting.ini
*Decided to save clusters as arrays of basic datatypes (can't save classes to trees)
*Putting off data reduction to PedestalAnalyze and ClusterAnalyze 
*Stand alone programs Display* allow visualizing data
--------------------

dev-2010-07-27-data_reduction:
*Data reduction done separately from SlidingPedestal and Clustering
*Dropped clustering output to root file layer; cluster on the fly
*DisplayRawEvent: Fixed detector mapping: 0,1,2,3 are now what used to be 3,2,1,0 and dia0 now refers to sirocco 4 while dia1 refers to sirocco 5; still haven't fixed this in the analysis
*STILL NEED TO FIX SetBinContent channel shift problem in most Event Displays!
*Added Taylor's speed tweak to SlidingPedestal.class.cpp
*Added Taylor's variable buffer size to SlidingPedestal.class.cpp
*NEED TO REDO DEFAULT CHANNEL SCREENS FOR X DETECTORS!
--------------------

dev-2010-07-29-clustering_take2:
*Fixed SetBinContent channel offset problem in event displays
*Added 3 and 5 sigma error bars to DisplayPSEvent
*Histograms and cutflow stats
*Fixed settings array parsing bug (first element in array always was zero)
*Better channel screening
--------------------

dev-2010-08-05-polishing_analysis:
*Added run stats to histograms
--------------------

dev-2010-08-11-polishing_analysis:
*Skip analysis for CMN and ZeroDivisor events (flagged in Sliding Pedestal)
*Removed CMN and "Bad" (aka zero divisor) event cuts; now flag, count, and save those events
*NOTE: Realize that due to scrambling of the data (example 0x3615abcd written in header as 0x1536cdab) and realizing that both silicon and diamond data is written down as 4-byte words, detectors should be swapped as follows: 0->3, 1->2, 2->1, 0->3, 4->5, 5->4; the last two say that dia0->dia1 and dia1->dia0
*Reversed silicon plane order and exchanged diamond inputs
*Updated channel screens
--------------------

dev-2010-08-14-polishing_analysis
*Created HTML summary page
*Fixed a slew of problems with the HTML summary page
*Fixed some cuts (now skip bad cluster events in silicon and clusters w/ bad seeds in diamond)
*Various other fixes
--------------------

dev-2010-09-02-taylors_plots
*Added ability to make Taylor's diagnostic plots with the new code
--------------------

dev-2010-09-16-harder_cuts
*Now cut clusters with any hit masked and an adjacent channel masked as well
*Fixed event displays event lookup
*Event displays now compile
--------------------


dev-2010-09-18-alignment
*ported alignment classes from april (initial results not convincing)
*fixed bug where TEvent::Sum2 overflowed => switched int to long
--------------------
